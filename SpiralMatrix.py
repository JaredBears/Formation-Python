# This is essentially a sliding window problem that slides horizontally and vertically.
# We will have four pointers, one for the start of the row, one for the end of the row, 
# one for the start of the column, and one for the end of the column.
# We will also create a return array "answer" and set it's length, as well as an idx 0.
# While the idx is less than the length of the answer, we will run through four "for loops" - 
# One for each direction.  After every single operation, we will increment the idx value.
# After the right loop, we will increment the row_start
# After the down loop, we will decrement the col_end
# After the right loop, we will decrement the row_end
# After the up loop, we will increment the col_start
# Once we've reached the end of the while loop, we will return the answer array.
# Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the total number of items.
# Space Complexity: O(n)
